Give me some idea on what is a Data type. What are Primitive Data types and Non-Primitive Data types. Explain with some examples.

A data type is used to mention what kind of data used in variable.

Types of data types:-
1.Primitive
2.Non-Primitive

1.Primitive:-It can store single values,they are default.
String,number,boolean,null,undefined are primitive datatypes.

String:-Sequence of characters enclosed within double quotes,single quotes,backticks.
Example:
let name = "John"; 
let greeting = 'Hello'; 
let template = Hi, ${name}; 


Number:-It stores all the number data such as integer,float values,etc..
Example:
let age = 25; 
let price = 19.99

Boolean:-true/false
Example:
let isStudent = true;
let isSenior = false;

Undefined:-Any variable declared but not initialized.
Example:
let uninitialized;
console.log(uninitialized); 

Null:-Empty of object
Example:
let emptyValue = null;


2.Non-Primitive:-It can store multiple values,they are user defined.
 functions, arrays , objects are primitive data types

Functions:-Represent a block of reusable code.
Example:
let greet = function() {
  console.log("Hello");
};

Arrays:-Store a collection of elements, indexed by numbers.
Example:
let fruits = ["Apple", "Banana", "Cherry"];

Objects:-Represent key-value pairs or more complex structures.
Example:
let person = {
  name: "Alice",
  age: 30,
  isStudent: false
};
